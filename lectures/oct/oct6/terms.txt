path: sequence of edges from one node to another
      (no repeating edges)
connected: if there's a path between any pair of nodes
Directed: edges have arrow/direction
DAG: directed *acyclic* graph
Acyclic: no paths from/to same node
Weakly connected: would be connected if direction didn't matter

Parent: edge outgoing
Child: edge incoming
Root: a node with no parent
Leaf: a node with no children

Tree: a DAG with two additional rules
1. only one root
2. every node (except root) has exactly one parent

Binary Tree: a tree with the additional rule
* each node has at most 2 children
